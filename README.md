# Welcome to Starter Templates

This kind of a collection of starter templates. Not too much configured, but some of the libraries and code configs already edited to save your time, because time = ðŸ’°
I will keep on adding more and more starter templates here, so stay tuned.

# Templates

Clone the repo or fork them, do whatever fits your work flow. If you got any issue, mention that in the **issue** section, but don't give any pull requests.
